## Track
**Track 1: MemoryAgent**

## Project name
**Mnemo — self-managing bi-temporal memory for AI agents**

## Elevator pitch (≤ 200 chars)
Persistent memory that stores, supersedes, forgets, and recalls under a context budget —
bi-temporal, no LLM in the read path, on Qwen Cloud, exposed over MCP + HTTP.

## Text description
**The problem.** LLM agents forget everything between sessions, and the memory layers
bolted on top mostly *append and retrieve* — they don't handle the hard parts: a fact
that **changes** over time, **forgetting** what's gone stale, and **recalling** the right
thing when the context window is small. Track 1 asks for exactly those three.

**Mnemo** is a memory service built around them:
- **Bi-temporal model** — every fact carries *event time* (`valid_at`/`invalid_at`) and
  *transaction time* (`created_at`/`expired_at`). When a fact changes, the old value is
  **superseded** (retired to history), not overwritten — so current recall returns only
  the truth *now*, while `recall(as_of=…)` can still answer "what did I believe in March".
- **Write-time distillation** — Qwen (`qwen3.6-flash`) turns raw messages into atomic
  facts with a stable `subject::attribute` key, so later updates reliably collide and
  supersede. A **hybrid index** also keeps raw verbatim slices so specific detail
  (durations, numbers) survives.
- **Timely forgetting** — salience-weighted recency decay; a sweep archives stale,
  low-value memories while pinned identity facts are never forgotten.
- **Recall under a budget** — `recall(char_budget=N)` fills to a token budget; the read
  path is pure vector + decay with **no LLM call**, so retrieval is fast.
- **MCP-native** — exposes `learn` / `recall` / `forget_stale` / `stats` so any MCP
  client (Claude Desktop, IDEs, other agents) gains persistent memory; also a FastAPI
  HTTP API.

**Built on Qwen Cloud** end-to-end: `text-embedding-v4` for retrieval, `qwen3.6-flash`
for distillation, `qwen3.7-plus` for reading — all via the OpenAI-compatible DashScope
(Alibaba Cloud Model Studio) API. Optional Alibaba Cloud OSS snapshots for durability.

**Honest evaluation (LongMemEval_S).** Recall@10 is on par with strong RAG (95%=95%).
Mnemo delivers the **best accuracy-per-token** (41.2 vs RAG 27.4 vs full-context 0.5 acc
per 1k reader-tokens) — matching most of RAG's answer quality on half the context. And in
the **long-horizon regime** — a fact updated many times — **RAG collapses (100%→50%) while
Mnemo holds 100%**, because supersession keeps exactly one current value instead of a pile
of stale ones. We're explicit about the weak spot: multi-hop temporal synthesis, where
compression costs accuracy. Full numbers in `docs/BENCHMARK.md`.

**What's novel.** A memory system engineered for the *accuracy-per-token* frontier and
*long-horizon robustness* rather than one-shot recall: bi-temporal supersession, a
world-model consistency rule (stale evidence of a superseded belief is retired), and
surprise-gated writes (predictive-coding efficiency) — exposed over MCP.
