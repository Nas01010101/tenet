Track 1: MemoryAgent

## Inspiration
Every LLM agent with "memory" today is really just RAG over a transcript log —
append-and-retrieve. That's fine until a fact *changes*: you move cities, change jobs,
update a preference, and the agent still has both the old and new statement sitting in
its retrieval pool, sometimes surfacing the stale one. Track 1 names the three things
retrieval memory structurally doesn't solve — facts that change, forgetting what's gone
stale, and recalling under a small context window — and that's exactly the gap Tenet is
built to close. The name comes from the idea of memory as something that has to stay
*internally consistent through time*, the way a bi-temporal ledger does: what's true
*now* vs. what we *used to believe*, kept distinct and both queryable.

## What it does
Tenet is a memory engine — and a personal assistant built on it (`src/tenet/agent.py`) —
that remembers you across sessions and stays correct when your facts change:

- **Bi-temporal supersession.** Every fact carries event time (`valid_at`/`invalid_at`)
  and transaction time (`created_at`/`expired_at`). When a fact changes, the old value is
  *superseded* — retired to history, not overwritten — so current recall returns only
  the truth *now*, while `recall(as_of=…)` answers "what did I believe in March."
- **Write-time distillation.** Qwen (`qwen3.6-flash`) turns raw messages into atomic
  facts with a stable `subject::attribute` key so later updates reliably collide and
  supersede, instead of piling up as near-duplicate passages.
- **Timely forgetting.** A salience-weighted decay sweep archives stale, low-value
  memories while pinned identity facts are never forgotten.
- **Recall under a budget, with zero LLM calls on read.** `recall(char_budget=N)` fills
  to a token budget with pure vector similarity + closed-form decay math — no model call,
  low-millisecond latency — plus an adaptive multi-hop `navigate()` on the same read path.
- **MCP-native.** `learn` / `remember` / `recall` / `doubts` / `time_travel` /
  `forget_stale` / `memory_stats` — any MCP client (Claude Desktop, an IDE, another
  agent) gets persistent, self-managing memory with no glue code
  (`src/tenet/mcp_server.py`).

## How we built it
Built on **Qwen Cloud end to end**, three distinct Qwen Cloud APIs each doing the job
it's best at, through one fail-loud provider layer (`src/tenet/config.py`) that swaps
Qwen/OpenRouter/Ollama by env var with zero code change:

- **`text-embedding-v4`** — retrieval (`config.embed_texts`).
- **`qwen3.6-flash`** — write-time distillation of raw messages into atomic
  `subject::attribute` facts (`src/tenet/distill.py`).
- **`qwen3.7-plus`** — the assistant's reader (`src/tenet/agent.py`).
- **MCP server** exposing the full bi-temporal surface, not just store/recall —
  including `doubts` (a staleness/confidence table over current facts) and `time_travel`
  (bi-temporal read as of an arbitrary past instant) — `src/tenet/mcp_server.py`.
- **A learned drift model, not a heuristic.** `dynamics.py` fits a closed-form
  Gamma-Lomax survival model *per key class* from the ledger's own supersession
  history (no hardcoded half-lives), plus a ripple term for correlated fact change.
- **Our own RTX-trained LoRA distiller**, for a fully local, air-gapped stack. Beyond
  swapping providers by env var, the write path's one LLM call (distillation) can run
  entirely offline on `tenet-distiller-1.5b-v2` — a Qwen2.5-1.5B model we LoRA-fine-tuned
  on an RTX 3080 to reproduce bi-temporal supersession with zero cloud calls
  (`scripts/distiller_lora/`). On a decontaminated held-out eval it hits 6/6 clean-churn
  supersessions, 0.0 fabrication, and 0.775 key-consistency — *beating* the cloud
  reference's own 0.707 (`docs/BENCHMARK.md` §10).
- Ships as a real product: `pip install tenet-memory` (once published), a CLI
  (`tenet chat/remember/recall/navigate/stats/doubts/sweep`), an HTTP API + a
  belief-ledger web demo (`src/tenet/static/index.html`), a LangGraph `BaseStore`
  adapter, and a 2-page paper + full preprint in `paper/`.

## Challenges we ran into
**The falsified-gate story.** We pre-registered success gates for two ideas before
running them, specifically so a negative result couldn't get quietly reframed as a win
afterward — and both gates failed, honestly reported rather than hidden:

- **Confidence-routed reader spend (gate not met).** The hypothesis: per-fact `p_valid` +
  a relevance margin could route reader spend across cheap/expensive tiers and cut token
  cost. An 84-config threshold sweep over 120 questions found *no* configuration saving
  tokens within 2pp of baseline; reaching the pre-registered ≥40%-savings cut cost
  −9 to −12pp accuracy, past the −5pp kill trigger. Diagnosis: `p_valid` is a **currency**
  signal (is this fact still fresh) — orthogonal to the *relevance* errors that actually
  sink extractive routing (the rank-1 belief is often the wrong attribute, not a stale
  one). Lesson kept and enforced in code: **confidence stays annotation-only**, never
  reordering or filtering recall — a real invariant, regression-tested
  (`scripts/test_agent_uncertainty.py::test_ranking_invariant`) after an earlier version
  of us tried rank-demoting doubted facts and watched a benchmark collapse 100% → 33%.
- **Multi-hop decomposition (clean null).** A Self-Ask-style query decomposition arm
  scored *identically* to the baseline on FactConsolidation multi-hop (25.0 vs 25.0,
  two questions flipped and offset each other) — below the pre-registered +15pp bar, so
  we didn't spend the larger confirmatory run. Combined with an earlier `navigate()` A/B
  null, this triangulates to an honest conclusion: at this backbone tier,
  FactConsolidation multi-hop is **reader-reasoning-bound**, not retrieval-pool-bound —
  no amount of cleverer retrieval construction moves that number; the bottleneck is hop
  composition in the reader itself.

**Stale raw-turn leakage under real conversational churn.** Our first high-churn stress
test (ChurnBench, several attributes each updated many times via paraphrased,
non-templated statements) found already-superseded raw turns slipping past the
write-time filter and outvoting the current fact at read time. Fixed with a read-time,
key-scoped consistency check plus a currency-structured reader context — churn half-life
rose from <2 to 8 — reported as a partial, honest fix (still short of a flat-32
half-life), not a full close of the gap (`docs/BENCHMARK.md` §9–9.1).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Numbers you can actually reproduce — in a field where that's rare.** Independent 2026
  audits (Maximem, Bench'd) found the headline agent-memory scores don't survive
  reproduction: Mem0 claims 93.4% on LongMemEval but reproduces at **73.8%** (57.5% pre-update; ~49% effective in production), and LoCoMo's own answer key is 6.4% wrong with a judge that accepts up to 63% of
  wrong answers. Tenet is built the opposite way: **every number carries a Wilson 95% CI**,
  we **ship four flags default-OFF because we measured them as no-benefit** (`RAW_RECALL`,
  `AGG_READER`, `RETRACT`, `CONSOLIDATE`), and we **publicly falsified our own pre-registered
  churn claim** before fixing it. Every result reproduces from one command.
- **Beats published SOTA on the standardized benchmark.** MemoryAgentBench (arXiv:2507.05257)
  FactConsolidation single-hop: **86.5%** [82.8, 89.5], above the published mini-tier SOTA
  of 78.0 — on a *weaker* local-7B backbone with zero-LLM, deterministic ingestion; ties
  multi-hop SOTA (30.2). All 800 questions, official metric + prompt verbatim, Wilson CIs.
- **Same-harness reproduction of four rival methods** (Mem0, CAR, HippoRAG-v2, MemAgent
  style) — Tenet leads every arm on both single- and multi-hop axes.
- **The regime RAG structurally can't scale to.** On a controlled knowledge-churn
  benchmark (a fact updated 2→12 times), naive RAG collapses 100%→50% past 8 updates;
  Tenet holds 100% throughout.
- **MAB Accurate-Retrieval: 59.3 average, 2nd of all published systems** (20+ points
  above Mem0/Zep/MemGPT), and beats every published memory framework on EventQA (70.7 vs 67.6; long-context baselines reach 82.6).
- Best accuracy-per-token on LongMemEval_S (49.2 vs RAG's 27.4 per 1k tokens).
- **Beats ReMe — Alibaba's own agent-memory framework — head-to-head, 67% vs 34%** on
  LongMemEval_S n=100, running ReMe's released pipeline end-to-end as a black box
  (its own `auto_memory` ingest + BM25 retrieval) with the identical Qwen reader/judge
  for every arm; McNemar p ≈ 2×10⁻⁶, Tenet ahead on every question type
  (`docs/BENCHMARK.md` §15).
- We report the honest losses too: multi-session synthesis and multi-hop chaining are
  documented weak spots, not hidden — every number reproduces from one CLI command
  (`tenet bench run <name>`, `docs/BENCHMARK.md`).

## What we learned
- **A well-calibrated signal isn't automatically a *useful* one for the thing you want to
  use it for.** `p_valid` is a genuinely good currency estimate, but currency and
  relevance are different axes of error — conflating them (as our routing attempt did)
  burns accuracy for a savings that never materializes.
- **Pre-registering the gate *before* running the experiment is what makes a negative
  result trustworthy** — and worth reporting instead of quietly shelving.
- **Annotation-only confidence is a real architectural invariant, not a nice-to-have** —
  we broke it once (rank-demoting doubted facts), watched accuracy fall off a cliff, and
  it's now enforced by a monkeypatch-based regression test, not just a docstring.
- **A zero-LLM read path pays off exactly where retrieval systems fail hardest** — the
  high-churn regime — because the mechanism keeping answers correct (bi-temporal
  supersession) is deterministic bookkeeping, not something an LLM has to get right on
  every read.

## What's next
- **Close the multi-session synthesis gap** (still 42.9 vs RAG's 57.1) with
  session-diverse retrieval — guaranteeing evidence coverage across distinct sessions
  instead of only deepening the sessions the top-*k* already surfaced.
- **Publish to PyPI** (`tenet-memory` — currently install-from-source only) and wire the
  README badge from placeholder to live.
- **Wider-N validation of the local LoRA distiller** — current numbers are a small,
  deterministic probe (n=26 messages / 8 churn groups), directionally strong but not yet
  a production SLA.
- **A learned graph traversal for multi-hop chaining.** We tried the cheap read-time levers
  for the RULER multi-hop loss and both were measured negatives — BM25+dense RRF ties baseline
  gold-in-pool exactly, and Self-Ask query decomposition *hurts* on a strong reader (error
  propagation). The gap is genuine graph-traversal territory (HippoRAG-style PPR), a different
  architecture — and, notably, mostly a weak-reader artifact: on the shipped `qwen3.7-plus`
  reader baseline RULER-MH is already ~60.6%, CI-overlapping the graph leader's 66.
