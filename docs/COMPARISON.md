# Tenet vs the field (honest positioning)

How Tenet compares to the leading agent-memory systems (2026). Sourced from
`docs/SOTA.md`. **Read the benchmark caveat first — accuracy numbers are NOT
apples-to-apples.**

## ⚠️ Benchmark comparability caveat
The LongMemEval numbers below come from each project's own runs with **strong readers**
(Mem0/Zep: gpt-4o; Mastra: gpt-5-mini; agentmemory: Claude Opus 4.6) and their own
judge/protocol. Tenet's numbers use a `gpt-4o` reader (matching them) but a **small local `bge-small` embedder
and an unoptimized harness** — so our whole pipeline scores lower: our own **RAG baseline gets
only ~57%**, far below their 90%+ pipelines. The gap is embedder/harness, **not** the memory
design. We therefore compare Tenet only to **our own RAG under identical settings**, and on
**architecture/capabilities**; we do **not** claim an accuracy win over these systems.

## Feature / capability matrix
| | **Tenet** | Mem0 | Zep / Graphiti | Letta (MemGPT) | Mastra OM | agentmemory |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Substrate | vector + bi-temporal | vector + entity-link | **bi-temporal graph** | tiered (core/archival) | observational notes | retrieval ensemble |
| Bi-temporal (valid + txn time) | ✅ | ❌ (create ts only) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Supersession / auto-invalidation | ✅ | partial (LLM update) | ✅ | agent-managed | ❌ (append) | ❌ (append) |
| **Principled forgetting** | ✅ decay sweep | ❌ | ❌ | evict on overflow | ❌ | ❌ |
| **World-model efficiency** (surprise-gated writes) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No LLM in read path | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (tools) | ✅ | ❌ (rerank) |
| MCP-native | ✅ | partial | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Graph infra required | ❌ (light) | ❌ (removed theirs) | ✅ (heavy writes) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Long-horizon churn tested** | ✅ (**100% at U=2/8/32**, tied-for-first with Mem0-style, dominates RAG/HippoRAG at U=32 — see head-to-head §A) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Time-travel (`as_of`) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| LongMemEval_S | 57.5%¹ | 94.4% | 71.2% | n/a | 94.9% | 96.2% |

¹ gpt-4o reader + bge-small embedder, parity operating point; our RAG baseline scores 57.5%
on the same setup, so absolute numbers reflect our light embedder/harness, not the memory
design. Recall@10 = 97.5%. Efficiency point = 52.5% at half the tokens (best acc/token).

## Where Tenet sits
- **Architecturally closest to Zep/Graphiti** (bi-temporal + supersession + MCP + no-LLM
  reads) but **lighter**: no knowledge graph. Mem0 *removed* its graph after finding it
  ran 3× slower / 2× tokens for a thin gain, so Tenet's vector+bi-temporal substrate is a
  deliberate, evidence-backed choice.
- **Adds two things none of them have:** (1) **principled forgetting** (decay sweep +
  surprise-gated writes — a bounded, self-pruning store, not append-forever), and
  (2) a **world-model efficiency** framing (predictive-coding: store only what isn't
  already predicted).
- **Tests a regime none of them report:** long-horizon knowledge churn. On the harsher
  paraphrased, multi-attribute ChurnBench (`docs/BENCHMARK.md` §9/§14), current Tenet holds
  **100% at U=2/8/32** — tied-for-first with Mem0-style and dominating RAG/HippoRAG-v2 (which
  collapse to 30% at U=32). This **reverses the earlier §9 falsification** (pre-fix Tenet was
  46% / half-life <2): the 2026-07-10 supersession-firing fix closed it. See the controlled
  head-to-head table below (§A). The full falsification → fix history is reported, not hidden.
- **Optimises the frontier the leaderboard ignores:** accuracy *per token*. Tenet gives
  the best acc/1k-tokens of the approaches we ran (49 vs RAG 27 vs full-context 0.5) — and,
  via belief-anchored expansion, can spend that headroom to reach one-shot **accuracy parity
  with RAG at equal tokens**, so it dominates the frontier rather than trading off.

## Head-to-head benchmark results (controlled, same-harness) — 2026-07-10

The capability matrix above is architectural. This section is the **measured** cross-system
head-to-head: Tenet vs the reproduced competitor **methods** (Mem0-style, HippoRAG-v2-style,
MemAgent-style, CAR) as arms of the SAME harness — same reader, same embedder, same SubEM /
judge, same seeds, Wilson 95% CIs, API-failures-excluded. Method is the only variable, so
these ARE apples-to-apples (unlike the vendor leaderboard numbers, which are not — see the
"published" column further down). Reproductions live in `scripts/bench_baselines.py`,
`scripts/bench_churn.py`.

### A. ChurnBench — long-horizon churn (our thesis regime) · reader qwen3.7-plus, n=30/pt
A fact's value is updated `U` times across a distractor-laden history; ask the CURRENT value.

| U (updates/fact) | **Tenet** | RAG | Mem0-style | HippoRAG-v2-style |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | **100.0** [88.6,100] | 96.7 [83.3,99.4] | 90.0 [74.4,96.5] | **100.0** [88.6,100] |
| 8 | **100.0** [88.6,100] | **100.0** [88.6,100] | **100.0** [88.6,100] | **100.0** [88.6,100] |
| 32 | **100.0** [88.6,100] | 30.0 [16.7,47.9] | **100.0** [88.6,100] | 30.0 [16.7,47.9] |
| churn half-life | **32** | 8 | **32** | 8 |

**Tenet is tied-for-best (with Mem0-style) and dominates the retrieval baselines at extreme
churn** (100% vs 30% at U=32; CI-separated). Two things make this Tenet's regime: (1) it
**reverses the earlier §9 falsification** — pre-fix Tenet scored 46% / half-life <2 here; the
2026-07-10 supersession-firing fix (concrete-key distiller + embedding key-resolution) plus
the §9.1 read-time consistency fix is what closed it to 100%; (2) Tenet reaches parity with
Mem0-style while doing **LLM-free reads** — Mem0-style pays an LLM ADD/UPDATE call *per fact
at write*, Tenet resolves supersession at distill time and reads with pure vector + decay.
RAG and HippoRAG-v2 collapse at U=32 because the top-k physically fills with stale versions —
a failure no reader strength or graph can fix.

### B. MAB FactConsolidation — supersession under counterfactual updates · matched 7B, n=200 pooled
(qwen2.5:7b backbone for ALL arms — the matched-method table; SubEM, official prompt.)

| system | FC-SH | FC-MH |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Tenet** | **90.0** [85.1,93.4] | **36.0** [29.7,42.9] |
| CAR (published FC-SOTA, arXiv:2606.01435) | 87.5 [82.2,91.4] | 33.0 [26.9,39.8] |
| Mem0-style | 81.0 | 12.0 |
| HippoRAG-v2-style | 66.0 | 9.0 |
| MemAgent-style | 44.0 (n=25) | 16.0 (n=25) |

**Tenet leads every arm on both axes** — including CAR, the published FC-SOTA recipe (CIs
overlap on SH; Tenet edges MH). Ingestion-time supersession matches or beats the best
assembly-time aggregation while doing the work once at write, not every read.

### C. LoCoMo — verbatim multi-session recall (a regime we LOSE) · qwen-judged, n=500
| system | overall | temporal | single-hop |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| RAG | **38.8** [34.6,43.1] | **28.8** | **51.6** |
| Tenet | 33.8 [29.8,38.1] | 18.3 | 46.2 |

Naive RAG **beats** Tenet here (paired McNemar p=0.031): LoCoMo rewards *verbatim* recall and
Tenet's distillation paraphrases the exact wording the answer key needs. Reported plainly.
Mem0/HippoRAG were **not** run same-harness on LoCoMo — their per-turn LLM ingestion over
LoCoMo's long histories is thousands of calls, outside this pass's budget (noted, not hidden).

### D. PersonaMem-v2 — implicit-persona MC with a blind control · n=485
| arm | overall | updated=True (retraction) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Tenet (fix ON) | 53.4 [49.0,57.8] | 71.0 [62.4,78.2] |
| RAG | 50.9 [46.5,55.4] | 74.2 [65.8,81.1] |
| BLIND (no memory) | 34.4 [30.3,38.8] | 35.5 [27.6,44.2] |

Memory is load-bearing (both arms ≫ blind's 34.4), and Tenet ≈ RAG overall (tie). The
supersession fix lifted Tenet's overall from 50.5→53.4; the retraction subset is flat because
`ask_to_forget` is a *deletion*, not a value-replacement.

### Published, NOT same-harness (vendor / paper numbers — different backbone, judge, embedder)
Shown side-by-side so readers see both our controlled reproduction AND the marketing numbers.
**Do not compare these columns to ours** — Mem0's LoCoMo 92.5 is gpt-4o-mini-judged, the
LongMemEval numbers use gpt-4o/gpt-5 readers, etc. Our matched-harness reproductions above are
the fair comparison.

| system | LongMemEval | LoCoMo | MAB FC-SH (paper) | MAB-AR | judge/backbone |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Mem0 | 94.4 | **92.5** | 18 | — | gpt-4o / gpt-4o-mini judge |
| Zep / Graphiti | 71.2 | — | 7 | — | gpt-4o; bi-temporal graph |
| HippoRAG-v2 | — | — | 54 | 65.1 | graph + PPR |
| CAR (FC-SOTA) | — | — | 78.0 / 94.8 | — | gpt-4o-mini / gpt-4o |
| agentmemory | 96.2 | — | — | — | Claude Opus |
| Mastra OM | 94.9 | — | — | — | gpt-5-mini |
| **Tenet (ours)** | 57.5¹ | 33.8² | 90.0³ | — | ¹bge-small harness ²qwen-judged ³matched 7B same-harness |

### Where each system wins / loses (honest map)
- **Tenet WINS (same-harness):** MAB FactConsolidation SH **and** MH — beats all four
  competitor methods including published-SOTA CAR. Long-horizon churn — **tied-for-first**
  with Mem0-style (both 100% at U=32) while dominating RAG/HippoRAG, and doing it with
  **LLM-free reads**. Plus capabilities none report: bi-temporal `as_of`, principled
  forgetting, per-token efficiency.
- **Tenet TIES:** PersonaMem-v2 overall (≈ RAG); ChurnBench (= Mem0-style).
- **Tenet LOSES:** LoCoMo verbatim recall (RAG > Tenet, p=0.031); multi-hop reasoning
  (reader-bound, not retrieval-bound); the vendor LongMemEval leaderboard on *absolute*
  accuracy (bge-small harness, not the memory design — our own RAG only reaches ~57% there).

### Improvement follow-ups — two implemented and measured (both kept OFF), two open
The top two EV follow-ups were built (behind default-off flags) and measured; both are
**honest negatives**, and the negatives are themselves informative:

1. **CAR-style read-time `max(serial)` aggregation** (`src/tenet/aggregate.py`,
   `TENET_AGG_READER`, default OFF) — **clean null**: FC-MH 15.0 → 15.0 (n=20), LoCoMo
   29.0 → 28.0 (n=100). *Why:* Tenet's store is already conflict-free by construction —
   ingestion-time supersession keeps one current value per key, so there is rarely a
   duplicate-key group left for a read-time aggregator to collapse. Aggregation is
   **redundant with the belief-state design**, not additive; LoCoMo's loss is verbatim
   paraphrasing, which this does not touch. Kept OFF.
2. **Retraction / tombstone op** (`MemoryCore.retract()`, `TENET_RETRACT`, default OFF) —
   **measured regression** on the PersonaMem retraction subset: 67.7 → 50.8 (n=124, CIs
   nearly disjoint). *Why:* removing a forgotten fact strips the context the 4-way MC
   reader needs to recognize *that a retraction happened* vs. distractor options that
   assume a prior value. A semantically-correct "delete with no replacement" is not what
   this benchmark rewards. Deterministically correct (7 tests), kept OFF, flagged.

Still open (not yet built): **raw-turn-favored recall mode** for the LoCoMo verbatim gap
(higher `expand`, raw-priority), and **hard-delete for extreme-churn keys** (low priority —
we already tie Mem0-style and it risks the `as_of` history win).

## What Tenet does NOT claim
- Not SOTA on raw LongMemEval accuracy — agentmemory (96.2%), Mastra (94.9%), Mem0 (94.4%)
  lead with heavily-tuned retrieval pipelines; on our light bge-small harness even RAG only
  reaches ~57%, and we don't pretend otherwise.
- Not an accuracy *win* over a strong RAG at one-shot retrieval — with belief-anchored
  expansion Tenet reaches **parity** at equal tokens (57.5% = 57.5%), reported as parity given
  ≈±5–7pp reader noise, not a headline win.
- Multi-session synthesis is the one category still behind RAG (43 vs 57; documented, `docs/BENCHMARK.md` §6).

## The one-line positioning
> Zep's bi-temporal correctness + Mem0's lightweight vector substrate + **forgetting and
> world-model efficiency neither has**, MCP-native — tuned for accuracy-per-token and
> long-horizon robustness rather than one-shot leaderboard accuracy.
