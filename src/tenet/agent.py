"""Tenet Assistant — a personal agent with self-managing memory (Track 1).

A conversational assistant that remembers you across sessions, stays correct when your
facts CHANGE (supersession), can recall what you *used* to say (time-travel), and forgets
stale trivia. This is the agent Track 1 asks for; Tenet (tenet/core.py) is its memory.

Run the interactive assistant:   python -m tenet.agent   (or the `tenet-agent` console script)
Powered by Qwen Cloud (config.py provider layer).
