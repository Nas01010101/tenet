"""Write-time distillation (Mnemo Upgrade B).

Turns a raw conversation turn / note into atomic, self-contained facts with a
semantic key for supersession, a salience score for forgetting, and an optional
event time. This is the Mem0 "extract salient facts on write" idea — and it's
what makes bi-temporal supersession reliable (embedding similarity alone can't
tell a value-change from a restatement; a stable `subject::attribute` key can).

One cheap LLM call per ingested message (qwen3.6-flash by default).

_SYS = """You extract durable, atomic facts from a message for an agent's long-term memory.
Return STRICT JSON: {"facts": [{"statement","key","salience","valid_at"}...]}.

Rules:
- statement: one self-contained fact. Resolve pronouns to names. No fluff.
- key: a stable "subject::attribute" slug (lowercase, snake_case), e.g.
  "user::residence", "user::coffee_pref", "project_nimbus::ship_date". The SAME
  real-world attribute must always get the SAME key so later updates supersede it.
  CRITICAL: the account owner / first-person speaker ("I", "me", "my", and any name
  they give for themselves) is ALWAYS the subject `user` — never their proper name.
  So "I live in X", "I moved to Y", "My name is Z" all use subject `user`
  (keys user::residence, user::residence, user::name). This keeps updates on the
  same attribute colliding on one key so later values supersede earlier ones.
- salience: 0.0-1.0. Durable/identity/preference/commitment facts are high (0.7-1.0);
  transient small talk is low (0.0-0.3). Skip pure chit-chat entirely.
- valid_at: an ISO-8601 date/time if the fact states when it becomes true, else null.
- Extract nothing (empty list) if there is no durable fact worth remembering.
Return ONLY the JSON object."""
