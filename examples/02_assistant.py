"""Minimal chat-loop assistant wired with Tenet as its memory — condensed
from Tenet's own reference assistant (src/tenet/agent.py in the repo).

Pattern: recall() before every turn to ground the system prompt in what's
remembered -> call YOUR LLM -> ingest() the user's turn so new/changed facts
are learned for next time. Tenet doesn't care which model answers, only what
it remembers — swap call_llm() for your own OpenAI/Anthropic/etc. client.

Run:
    pip install tenet-memory openai
    export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...   # or point call_llm() at your own provider
    python examples/02_assistant.py
