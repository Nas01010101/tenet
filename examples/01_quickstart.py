"""Quickstart: remembering facts, updating them, and time-travel recall.

Shows the core Tenet loop:
  1. ingest()  — turn a raw message into distilled, keyed facts (one LLM call)
  2. recall()  — the read path: pure vector similarity + decay, NO LLM call
  3. a fact changing — same semantic key ("user::residence") means the new
     value SUPERSEDES the old one instead of duplicating it
  4. time-travel — recall(as_of=<timestamp>) answers what was true THEN, not
     now; history is preserved, never deleted

Run:
    pip install tenet-memory
    export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...      # or: LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter EMBED_PROVIDER=local
    python examples/01_quickstart.py

Uses a throwaway on-disk DB (a tempdir) so it's safe to re-run.
