"""Zero-key demo — Tenet's core belief-state loop with NO API key, NO network.

The "wow in 60 seconds" script: no DASHSCOPE_API_KEY, no OpenAI key, nothing to
sign up for. `EMBED_PROVIDER=local` is forced below (sentence-transformers,
CPU) BEFORE tenet is imported, so this runs on a fresh clone the moment
`pip install -e ".[local]"` (or, once published, `pip install tenet-memory[local]`)
finishes.

This intentionally bypasses `Tenet.ingest()` (which distills raw text via one
LLM call — see distill.py) and calls `store_fact()` / `core.store()` directly
with pre-formed (text, key) pairs instead. That's the honest tradeoff of a
zero-key demo: write-time distillation needs a model; **recall, supersession,
time-travel, and doubts do not** — they're pure vector-similarity + sqlite +
a closed-form statistical fit over the ledger, by design (see memory.py's
module docstring: "recall... no LLM in the read path"). A real deployment
still wants `ingest()` for free-form conversation; this demo shows the part
of Tenet that works without ever calling out to a model.

Run (from a clone):
    pip install -e ".[local]"
    python examples/00_zero_key_demo.py
